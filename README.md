# Large-Language-Models-for-Arabic-Tags-Generation
In this repository, we will be in the process of fine-tuning four different large language models (LLMs) using an Arabic dataset. We'll delve into the intricacies of adapting these models to perform specialized tasks in Arabic natural language processing. 

Our objective is straightforward: to use LLMs to automatically generate descriptive tags for Arabic quotes. 
This task not only demonstrates the linguistic prowess of LLMs but also showcases their potential in Arabic language applications.
