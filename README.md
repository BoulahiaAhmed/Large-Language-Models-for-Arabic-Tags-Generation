Welcome to the repository for our project on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for Arabic tags generation. 

In this project, we explored the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and generating Arabic words for tags associated with quotes. Our journey included innovative techniques like 4-bit quantization with QLoRA to optimize the fine-tuning process.
